## Scorings

We automatically generate scorings based on usage we have detected automatically.
These scorings may be out of touch with reality, but generally they are very helpful to quickly match our product portfolio with the actual needs of the contact.
Scoring is divided into fit and interaction. Fit is classified into A, B and C, where A is the best fit and C the worst. Interaction is classified into 1, 2 and 3, where 1 is the highest degree of interaction and 3 the lowest. 
Every contact has a scoring in the following areas: ESG, Climate, Supply Chain, and EUDR. These scorings range from A1 (best) to C3 (worst). Contacts with A1, A2 and B1 have the highest priority in sales outreach, contacts with C3 the lowest. 
A low scoring does not necessarily mean that the contact is not wortth contacting at all, but it gives a good general guidance.  

### Scoring for individual hubs

Certain information classify contacts for a fit regarding certain hubs. VERSO is operating with the following three hubs: ESG Hub, Climate Hub, and Supply Chain Hub.
