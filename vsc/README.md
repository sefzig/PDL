# VS Code Syntax for PDL

This folder contains a lightweight VS Code extension that adds Prompt Data Language highlighting to:
- `.pdl` files
- fenced code blocks with language `pdl`
- inline directives inside Markdown

Install (dev): open this folder in VS Code and run `npm install` + `vsce package`, then install the generated `.vsix`.
